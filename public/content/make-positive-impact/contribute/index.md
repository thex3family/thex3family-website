## Why Contribute?

Your contributions, regardless of their size, are immensely valuable to us. We are reinventing what giving back to the community means. We are enabling anyone around the world to contribute towards the development and growth of programs that have helped them in their growth journey.

Whether you have a few minutes or several hours, there's a way for you to contribute.

## Benefits To Contributing

### Tangible Benefits

Contributors get access to meaningful perks to help them improve their lives. You'll get special roles in our community, access to exclusive events, mentors, behind-the-scenes content, exclusive tools, and more.

### Intangible Benefits

We are committed to showcasing and making the efforts you've made visible. Every time you contribute, you will be able to see the impact of the efforts that you've made.

## Contributor vs Collaborator?

We want to give everyone the opportunity to make positive impact without a large commitment, so we've opened up opportunities for quick, ad-hoc contributions. When you want to contribute on a more permanent basis, you can apply to be a [collaborator](/make-positive-impact/collaborate).
