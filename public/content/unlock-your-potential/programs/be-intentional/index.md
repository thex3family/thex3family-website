## Why Did We Build This?

After Conrad solved his motivation challenges with **[Gamify Your Life](/unlock-your-potential/programs/gamify-your-life)**, he realized that motivation alone isn’t enough for long-term success. You can be extremely driven and motivated, but if, at the end of the journey, you're not happy with what you've achieved, you will feel that all that effort is for nothing. 

So, he built **Be Intentional** to address this gap—to help you find meaning in your life and make sure your hard work leads to the success you truly want. Being intentional means knowing the **Why**, **What**, and **How** behind everything you do. It’s about aligning your efforts with your purpose, so you can confidently aim for goals that bring meaning to your life. 

In 2020, he shared Be Intentional to the world to help people lead their life with intention, making sure that each action is purposeful and leads you closer to the outcome you truly desire.

## How Does It Work?

There are countless ways to implement the **Be Intentional** system in your own life. You can start simply by keeping an intention journal or breaking down your big goals into key results, then mapping out the projects and tasks that will get you there.

But we know that jumping in with the right tools can help you implement these principles into your life much easier. That’s why we’ve spent thousands of hours building ready-made templates for various productivity platforms, each designed to take advantage of the strengths of the platform to help you plan with intention.

### **Notion Templates**

We chose Notion as the core platform for **Be Intentional** because of its ability to connect your thinking. Notion’s database relations allow us to connect databases together, helping us stay intentional about the different parts of our life that needs to come together to build out our purpose.

You can plan for success, track your intentions, build your network, knowledge, and so much more—and also build upon the templates we’ve created to suit your unique needs.
