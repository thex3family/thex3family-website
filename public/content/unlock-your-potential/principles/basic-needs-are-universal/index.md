## Introduction

**Basic Needs Are Universal** highlights the fundamental truth that, regardless of our differences, all humans share the same basic needs. These essentials—food, water, shelter, safety, and connection—are what bind us together. Recognizing this commonality allows us to better empathize with others and creates a foundation for cooperation and mutual support. We can turn to others for help with our basic needs because they too understand the drive to fulfill these core desires.

In this article, we’ll explore how recognizing universal needs fosters empathy and helps us build stronger communities that support one another.

## Prerequisites

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:  
- Feeling connected to others through shared hardships or challenges.  
- Recognizing that everyone needs the same basic essentials to survive.

## Why Basic Needs Are Universal

At the core of human survival are shared, fundamental needs: food, water, shelter, and safety. These basic requirements transcend cultural, social, and economic boundaries, linking us to one another. This is because humanity has spent most of its existence ensuring these survival needs, with modern civilization being just a small fraction of our evolutionary history. This makes it natural for us to empathize with others facing similar needs.

When someone is hungry, cold, or lacking safety, we can connect on a deep, instinctual level, even if our backgrounds and circumstances differ. This shared foundation helps us be effective in offering help and receiving support.

## Applying This Principle

Understanding that basic needs are universal reminds us that we are most effective in helping others—and being helped—when it comes to these shared needs.

When struggling with basic needs, reaching out is easier because these are challenges everyone understands. Other people will naturally empathize with survival struggles because they have faced or can imagine similar situations.

_“If I’m struggling with finding food or shelter, I can seek help, knowing that others will understand and offer support.”_

Higher-order desires may require understanding from someone who’s had a more similar journey, but basic needs unite us all.
