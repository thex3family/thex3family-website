## Introduction

**Quests You Get To Do, Not Have To Do** is a principle inspired by the world of gaming, where tasks or quests are seen as exciting opportunities to gain experience, gold, or other rewards. In video games, quests are core elements that push players forward with enthusiasm rather than dread. But in real life, we often treat similar tasks like chores—something we “have” to do. What if we could reframe these tasks as quests we *get* to do, opening up opportunities for growth, learning, and rewards?

In this article, we’ll explore how to shift your mindset to see tasks and responsibilities as engaging quests that help you level up in life.

## Prerequisites

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:
- Feeling excited about tasks in games but dreading similar tasks in real life.
- Enjoying the feeling of achievement and reward from completing quests.

## Why Reframing Tasks as Quests Matters

In games, we look forward to quests because they offer rewards like XP, gold, or items that help us level up. Real-life tasks, however, are often seen as burdens—something we have to do, rather than something we get to do. The problem isn’t the task itself but our mindset around it. When we reframe tasks as quests, we turn everyday activities into opportunities for growth, learning, and rewards, making them more engaging and less of a chore.

## Shifting From “Have To” to “Get To”

The simple shift in language from “have to” to “get to” can make a profound difference in how we approach tasks. By adjusting how we view tasks, we can transform obligations into opportunities. Instead of seeing a task as a burden, reframing it as a chance to improve yourself or make progress turns it into a meaningful quest. It’s no longer something you’re forced to do; it becomes something you choose to do for your own benefit.

Additionally, in games, quests come with clear rewards that motivate players to take action. Similarly, in life, assigning rewards to tasks can motivate you to complete them with a sense of purpose and enjoyment. By treating each task as a quest with rewards—whether it's learning a new skill, finishing a project, or even something as simple as doing chores—you can stay engaged and excited about your progress.

## How To Turn Chores Into Quests

Here are some practical ways to reframe your everyday tasks into exciting quests:

### 1. Assign XP and Rewards

Treat tasks as quests where you can earn XP (experience points) or other meaningful rewards. For example, completing a challenging project at work can earn you points toward a personal reward like a day off, a treat, or even leveling up in your personal "game." The more complex the task, the more XP or rewards you assign, turning tough tasks into rewarding challenges.

### 2. Create a Quest Log

Keep track of your quests (tasks) in a quest log. This could be a journal, a digital tool, or even a [Notion Template](/unlock-your-potential/programs/gamify-your-life) where you log tasks as quests, track progress, and collect rewards. Seeing your progress and achievements builds motivation and makes everyday tasks more fun. A quest log allows you to visually track how far you've come and provides momentum for tackling future tasks.

### 3. See Your Growth in Numbers

Just like in a game, completing quests means leveling up. Make sure you have a way to visualize your growth and see the progress you're making. This visual representation of growth reinforces the idea that every task completed brings you closer to being your best self.
