## Introduction

**Perspective Changes Rewards** is a principle that highlights how the rewards that motivate us shift depending on our stage in life and our changing perspectives. What drives us at one point in our journey may not hold the same value later. As we grow and evolve, so do the things we seek as rewards. By understanding this dynamic, you can align your efforts with rewards that resonate with your current goals and desires, helping you stay motivated and focused.

In this article, we’ll explore why rewards change based on perspective and how you can stay flexible with your motivators, ensuring that the rewards you pursue continue to push you toward growth and success.

## Prerequisites

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:
- Noticing that the rewards you used to value no longer inspire or motivate you.
- Realizing that achieving some goals left you feeling less fulfilled than expected.
- Changing your goals and needing different incentives to stay driven.

## Why Rewards Change with Perspective

As we grow, our needs, wants, and values evolve. This is why the rewards that once motivated us—like external validation, financial incentives, or short-term pleasures—might not hold the same power as we move through different stages of life. Your perspective is shaped by your experiences, challenges, and aspirations. As your focus shifts from, for example, immediate success to long-term growth or from individual achievement to community impact, the rewards that matter most to you will also change.

### Different Stages, Different Motivations

At various stages of life, you're motivated by different things. Early in your career or personal development journey, you might seek rewards like recognition, financial gains, or competitive achievements. As you mature and your priorities shift, you may find yourself more motivated by mastering a skill, making a meaningful impact, or pursuing personal fulfillment.

These changes are natural and expected. By staying flexible and recognizing how your perspective influences the rewards you seek, you can continue to motivate yourself in ways that feel meaningful and aligned with your current ambitions.

### Predicting Accurate Rewards

Understanding the perspective you view the world through will help you predict which rewards will be most meaningful to you at any given point in time. For instance, in the [**Better Life Framework**](/understand-yourself/better-life-framework), different perspectives—like **Perspective 3: Winning** or **Perspective 4: Belonging**—shape what we find valuable as rewards.

At **Perspective 3: Winning**, you're likely driven by visible achievements and competitive success. But as you shift into **Perspective 4: Belonging**, you might place greater emphasis on community, connection, and contribution. Understanding these shifts allows you to set rewards that match your current stage, keeping your motivation aligned with your deeper goals.

Additionally, your rewards evolve as you move through the [**Evolution of Wants**](/understand-yourself/evolution-of-wants)—from seeking possessions (having), to pursuing meaningful experiences (doing), to achieving internal fulfillment (being).

## How to Adjust Your Rewards Based on Perspective

Here are some practical strategies to ensure your rewards evolve with you:

### 1. Understand Yourself

Use philosophies like the [**Better Life Framework**](/understand-yourself/better-life-framework) and [**Evolution of Wants**](/understand-yourself/evolution-of-wants) to understand your current perspective. This will help you identify what rewards matter most to you right now and adjust your motivators accordingly.

_"At this stage, I realize personal growth is more important than recognition, so my rewards should reflect that."_ 

### 2. Identify What Will Drive You Next

Look at where you are in your journey and consider what might drive you as you grow. Are you moving from external validation toward internal fulfillment? Adjust your rewards to match where you’re headed, not just where you are now.

_"As I transition to a more community-oriented perspective, I'll seek rewards that indicate that I'm helping my community rather than just for individual success."_

### 3. Be Flexible and Understanding

Recognize that the rewards you desire might change by the time you achieve your goal. Don’t be afraid to shift your incentives if they no longer resonate with your current perspective.

_"While I initially thought financial success would be the ultimate reward, I now value work-life balance and fulfillment more."_
