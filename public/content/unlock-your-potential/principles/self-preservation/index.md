## Introduction

**Self-Preservation** is one of the most fundamental human instincts—the drive to protect oneself from harm and ensure survival. This instinct encompasses both physical and psychological behaviors, such as avoiding danger, securing basic needs like food and shelter, and protecting our well-being in threatening situations. It is the cornerstone of human survival, influencing our decision-making and responses to adversity in daily life.

In this article, we’ll explore how self-preservation drives our actions, why it’s a critical aspect of human behavior, and how embracing this instinct can keep us safe, balanced, and prepared for adversity.

## Prerequisites

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:
- Taking actions to secure your basic needs (safety, shelter, food).
- A compelling force taking over your actions in dangerous situations.

## The History of Self-Preservation

Self-preservation isn’t just about surviving extreme situations; it’s an instinct guiding us through everyday life. Whether avoiding danger, securing resources, or defending ourselves, self-preservation plays a crucial role. This drive often operates unconsciously, influencing decisions we may not even realize are rooted in survival instincts.

For millions of years, humans have relied on this instinct to navigate dangerous environments filled with predators and hazards. Though the threats we face today have evolved, the instinct for self-preservation remains deeply embedded in our psychology. It drives our behavior, ensuring immediate survival when needed—such as eating when hungry or drinking when thirsty—because it is hardwired into our biology.

## Embracing Self-Preservation

Rather than resist this instinct, embracing it can help us push through tough times. When we are at our lowest, our survival instinct kicks in and fuels action. This is the same drive referenced by visionaries like Steve Jobs when he encouraged people to "Stay Hungry" if they wished to achieve great things. Self-preservation pushes us to move forward, even when the odds are stacked against us. 

Sometimes, we even tap into this instinct even when we aren't in danger in the literal sense. For example, we might stay up late to finish a project because we feel a strong compulsion to get it done "before it's too late". This makes self-preservation a powerful motivator for getting things done, at all costs.
