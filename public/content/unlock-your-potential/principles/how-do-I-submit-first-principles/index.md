This template is designed to help you structure your content when creating pages for new principles. Try and stick to this structure as closely as possible. However, if you have an idea that doesn't fit perfectly, feel free to let us know. We can discuss the best way to incorporate it.

## Introduction

Start with a brief introduction that outlines the principle. Explain the core idea and **what the reader will learn** after understanding this principle. Aim to keep it concise yet informative to hook the reader.

## Prerequisites

What should someone already know or be familiar with before reading this page? List any prior knowledge, concepts, or skills that would help the reader fully understand the principle.

## [Section Name]

Break down the principle into **clear sections** that explore it in detail. Use examples and practical applications where possible.

If referencing another concept, be sure to explain it or suggest a link for the user to get more information on that topic. If you're using diagrams or visuals, make sure they are fully explained for accessibility purposes. Include a clear description of what each visual is demonstrating and how it relates to the principle.

Feel free to suggest sub-pages - if a topic starts to sprawl we can create sub-pages to make the reading experience better. If there's a way for a user to put what you've taught into practice, try and funnel them into doing that.
