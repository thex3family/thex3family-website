## Introduction

**Short-Term Gain, Long-Term Pain** is the idea that while short-term actions may bring immediate relief or benefits, they can often have long-term consequences that we need to consider. Our instincts, particularly when it comes to survival, push us toward quick solutions when faced with immediate needs—such as hunger, discomfort, or stress. However, these quick fixes can sometimes undermine our long-term well-being.

In this article, we’ll explore how to balance taking short-term actions while keeping in mind their long-term effects.

## Prerequisites

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:  
- Acting impulsively to meet an immediate need.
- Regreting its long-term consequences afterwards.

## Why We Crave Short-Term Gains

Our brains are wired for immediate gratification, a trait that was essential for survival in the past. When we’re cold, hungry, or stressed, our survival instincts drive us to take immediate action to alleviate those conditions. This is beneficial for short term survival, but the cost comes when those actions carry negative long-term consequences, especially if we follow our instincts to the extreme.

*For example, eating food immediately to satiate hunger is necessary, but if we consume all our supplies without adequate rationing we will just be hungry soon.*

## Mindful Short-Term Actions

It’s important for us to recognize when short-term actions are necessary and when they might have long-term consequences. While our survival instincts push us toward immediate action, being mindful allows us to meet short-term needs without compromising our future well-being.

### 1. Act in Moderation

When faced with extreme hunger or discomfort, it can be tempting to consume everything immediately or use up all available resources. However, acting in moderation ensures that we don’t exhaust our resources and have enough left for future needs.

_“I’m starving, but instead of ripping open all the food, I’ll eat just enough to satisfy my hunger now and save the rest for later.”_

### 2. Small Sacrifices for Future Gain

Making small sacrifices in the present can lead to better outcomes in the long run. For instance, drinking water slowly over time is actually more beneficial than gulping it all at once.

_“I’ll sip water slowly over time, allowing my body to stay hydrated more effectively and prolong the benefits.”_

### 3. Prioritize the Most Impactful Survival Actions

In survival situations, not all actions are equally important. Oftentimes, we can take actions that will benefit both short-term and long-term survival.

_“I need to find shelter, but I’ll take a moment to assess which option offers the best protection now and will continue to keep me safe in the future.”_
