## Introduction  

**Love With No Expectations** is a principle that teaches us that true love is given freely, without hidden conditions or unspoken expectations. Often, we believe we are experiencing and giving unconditional love, but in reality, our love is conditional based on the perspective we hold.

In this article, we’ll explore how love changes across different perspectives and what it means to love with no expectations.

## Prerequisites  

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:  
- Feeling disappointed and hurt when we don't feel loved by others.  
- Realizing that your love for others often depends on their actions or behavior.

## Why Love Often Comes With Expectations  

We generally perceive love as the extreme of whichever perspective we are in. If we help or are helped to achieve what we want in a perspective, we consider that love.

| **Systems**     | Sharing systems we think are useful. | They have to follow, use, and improve our systems. |

| **Boundaries**  | Honoring their boundaries. | They should never cross our boundaries. |

## How to Love With No Expectations  

Here are practical strategies to incorporate this principle into your life:

### 1. Recognize Our Expectations  

Reflect on the situations that may cause us to stop sharing our love to those in our life. Are we loving based on what others provide us, or can we love them even when they don’t fulfill our expectations?

_“Am I loving them because of what they provide in my life, and can I love them even when they don’t?”_

### 2. Shift Toward Empathy  

No matter which perspective we are at, go up one step at a time. Try to elevate what love means in our relationships, and slowly change your expectations, until you reach the point where we love others for their being, not for what they offer us. 

_“We change all the time, so let's make the constant love.”_

### 3. Protect Yourself

Remember, loving someone doesn't mean we have to do things for others. If someone challenges our love for them, that means that they are perceiving love in their perspective—and we don't have to conform to that.

The beauty of the [Better Life Framework](/understand-yourself/better-life-framework) is that as you level up, you automatically expose those around you to your new perspective and will passively grow with you—should they choose to.

_“We love each other in our own way, and that's OK.”_
