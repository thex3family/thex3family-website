## Introduction

**Reward What Matters** is a principle focused on using rewards strategically to align with tasks that truly drive results. The way we assign rewards influences how actions are prioritized—often both consciously and subconsciously. By ensuring that the rewards we offer match the importance of the task, we encourage focus on high-impact actions that lead to growth and success.

In this article, we’ll explore how to apply this principle to prioritize tasks, and ensure that the most meaningful efforts are being rewarded appropriately, both in personal development and in a team setting.

## Prerequisites

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:
- Prioritizing actions that did not serve us long-term for short-term benefits. 
- Noticing that the reward influenced how much time or energy you invest.

## Why You Should Reward What Matters

Rewards have a powerful influence on how we choose to spend our time and effort. When we assign rewards that align with high-impact tasks, we consciously and subconsciously guide ourselves (or others) to focus on what truly matters. On the flip side, if we reward low-value tasks, we may end up encouraging busy work or activities that don't contribute significantly to our goals.

### The Psychology of Prioritizing Through Rewards

The human brain is wired to seek rewards. Whether it’s immediate gratification or the promise of long-term gains, rewards drive our behavior. By rewarding tasks that are meaningful and have a high impact, you reinforce the habit of focusing on what matters most, leading to more productive outcomes. If rewards are tied to low-priority tasks, it can lead to wasted time, misplaced focus, and lack of progress on key objectives.

### Reinforcing the Right Behaviors

In both personal growth and and working with others, rewarding what matters helps reinforce behaviors that lead to long-term success. By clearly tying rewards to high-value outcomes, you ensure that the effort goes where it’s needed most. This encourages sustained focus and the ability to prioritize key tasks over less important ones.

## Strategies for Rewarding What Matters

Here’s how you can start applying this principle:

### 1. Identify High-Impact Tasks

Not all tasks are created equal. Take time to assess which tasks are truly moving you closer to your goals. High-impact tasks usually have long-term benefits, help build valuable skills, or significantly push projects forward. Focus rewards on these actions to ensure they remain a priority.

### 2. Align Rewards with Outcomes

Make sure that the [rewards matches the effort](/unlock-your-potential/principles/reward-should-match-effort). For personal development, this might mean offering more meaningful rewards for big milestones (like learning a new skill or completing a major project). When managing a team, ensure that recognition or bonuses reflect the value and impact of the work being done.

### 3. Avoid Over-Rewarding Low-Impact Tasks

It can be easy to fall into the trap of rewarding tasks that feel satisfying in the moment, but don’t actually move the needle. Be mindful of how often you reward tasks that don’t contribute to significant growth or results. This helps prevent misalignment in priorities.

_This doesn’t mean small tasks should never be rewarded, but the emphasis should always be on rewarding tasks that lead to long-term growth._
