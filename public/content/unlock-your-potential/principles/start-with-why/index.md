## Introduction  

**Start With Why** is a principle that emphasizes the importance of understanding the deeper purpose behind your actions. Knowing *why* you're doing something serves as the foundation for motivation, direction, and fulfillment. When we have a clear understanding of our "why," the "how" and "what" become easier to manage, allowing us to navigate challenges and stay aligned with our goals.

In this article, we’ll explore the significance of starting with why (also known as "Being Intentional") and how understanding the purpose behind your actions can lead to long-term success.

## Prerequisites  

You'll resonate with this principle if you've had any of the following experiences:  
- Feeling lost or unmotivated in your tasks or goals.  
- Noticing that goals tied to a deeper purpose feel more rewarding.  

## Why Starting with "Why" Matters  

Starting with "why" serves as a compass that guides our actions, allowing us to navigate challenges with greater clarity and focus. It's the emotional core behind what we do, offering a sense of purpose that can sustain motivation even when things get tough. Many people jump straight to *what* they want to achieve without fully understanding *why* it matters. This lack of clarity often leads to burnout or feeling disconnected from the goals they're pursuing.

### Knowing Your Why Fuels Motivation  

When we understand our deeper purpose, we’re more likely to stay committed to our goals, even in the face of adversity. Knowing our “why” provides us with emotional fuel, making it easier to keep pushing forward. Whether we’re pursuing a professional goal or a personal dream, having a strong sense of purpose increases resilience and fosters long-term success.

### Knowing Why Gives You Clarity

Knowing why gives us clarity in determining whether our actions are aligned with our values and goals. This alignment helps us feel more accomplished when we are on the right track. Ultimately, clarity builds confidence, allowing us to focus on the things that matter most and take effective action.

## How to Start with Why  

Here are some practical ways to incorporate this principle into daily life:

### 1. Identify Your Why  

Before diving into a project or task, ask why it matters to us to get it done. The why should be something we truly believe in that will motivate us even when the journey gets tough.

_“Why am I trying to work out? Is it for being healthy, looking better, or...?”_

### 2. Determine What  

Once you've identified your "why," the next step is to determine *what* specific actions or outcomes will fulfill that deeper purpose. Set clear, key results or outcomes that align with your motivation. 

A goal without a key result is just a dream; the probability of it succeeding is very low, since you don't have a clear idea of what it takes to get there. The clearer, the better, because the actions that we end up taking will drive us towards the results that we want.

_“Specifically, I want to be able to run 5km without passing out.”_

### 3. Discover How  

Finally, map out *how* you’ll achieve those goals. This is where your plan of action comes into play—what steps will you take, and what resources will you need? Tasks without a clear why or what is just a hobby because you're not taking effective actions towards the success that you want.

Break down your project into manageable tasks, and adapt as you progress. 

_“I’ll start by buying running shoes, and then doing a small run every day.”_
