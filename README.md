This is the repository for [the.x3.family](https://the.x3.family) website, a resource for the Co-x3 Family Foundation. Our mission is to _“To equip students, creatives, and retirees with knowledge to level up every day, tools to put their learning into action, and a community to never struggle alone."_ - read more about what this means [here](https://the.x3.family/live-your-best-life/about-us).

[the.x3.family](https://the.x3.family) is being improved and changed over time through the contributions of community members who submit content, give feedback, or volunteer their time to manage its evolution. 

If you’re interested in supporting us, find out [how to contribute](https://the.x3.family/make-positive-impact/contribute/). We also host online spaces to have meaningful conversations – come share your ideas or just say hi over [in our community](https://our.x3.family/).

## How To Contribute

Contributions of any kind are welcome! We follow the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/overview) specification, which means we recognize contributors to an open-source project in a way that rewards every contribution, not just code.

### 1. Submit An Issue

- Create a [new issue](https://github.com/thex3family/thex3family-website/issues/new/choose).
- Comment on the issue (if you'd like to be assigned to it) - that way [our team can assign the issue to you](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/).

More information on the issue creation process, and expectations around creating issues can be [found here](docs/github-issue-triage-process.md).

### 3. Set Up Your Local Environment

If you're ready to contribute and create your PR, it will help to set up a [local environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git) so you can see your changes. 

### 4. Make Awesome Changes!

1. Create new branch for your changes (download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already)

```sh
yarn dev
```

3. Commit and prepare for pull request (PR). In your PR commit message, reference the issue it resolves (see [how to link a commit message to an issue using a keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)).

```

4. Push to your GitHub account

```

### 5. Submit Your PR

  - ex. `Updates out of date content [Fixes #1234]`
- Vercel (our hosting service for build previews) deploys all PRs to a publicly accessible preview URL.
- _Confirm your GC preview deploy looks & functions as expected_
