  "page-about-us-history-slide-2-description-1": "As our community grew, we realized the best way to help as many people as possible is by organizing as a 501(c)(3) non-profit focused on creating value and making positive impact.  As such, we guarantee that 80% of our programs remain free of charge, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity. For the remaining 20%, we adopt a fair pricing model, covering only essential costs. This approach not only ensures our self-sufficiency but also encourages valuable feedback, fostering continuous improvement.",
  "page-about-us-history-slide-2-description-2": " To achieve our ambitious targets, we've set up a growth fund - drawing support from governments, foundations, institutions, and individuals who resonate with our mission and vision.
