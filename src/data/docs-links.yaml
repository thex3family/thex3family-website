# This is the source file for documentation nav links
# Each `id` value should map to an equivalent key in src/intl/${lang}.json file

# To display item as a collapsable directory vs. a link
# use the `path` property (of the directory) vs. the `to` property. We use /principles for all paths for now until we have proper folder management
